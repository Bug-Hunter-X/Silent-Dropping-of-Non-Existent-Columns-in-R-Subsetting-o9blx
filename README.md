This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in R programming related to subsetting data frames using character vectors. When you try to subset a data frame using column names that don't exist, R silently drops those names and proceeds without any error messages, potentially leading to unexpected results and making debugging harder. The `bug.r` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.r` offers a solution.  The bug is that R silently ignores columns that do not exist, causing unexpected behavior.
